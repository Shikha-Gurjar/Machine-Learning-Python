##### Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
> It is a subset of __Artificial Intelligence__. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

- Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. 
- The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
